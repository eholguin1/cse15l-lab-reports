## Lab Report 5 - Week 9 (Putting It All Together)

# Debugging Scenario 

A student getting errors on an assignmnet in 15L and needs help with debugging the errors and posted a post on EdStem asking for help:

**What enviornment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

> Mac (operating system), VSCode (terminal/editor)

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. 
Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

> fs

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, 
command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
